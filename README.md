Backbone.PushStateRouter
========================

A simple way to setup a Backbone router that works seemlessly with HTML5 pushstate. Inspired by wanting a simple pushstate router for [Meteor projects](http://meteor.com/).

Read the source code for the documentation.

Startup the test by running `meteor` in this directory.
